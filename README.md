# mpkmeans
experimental code


There are six variants to perform kmeans

StandardKMeans1: the native kmeans algorithm using distance 1

StandardKMeans2: the native kmeans algorithm using distance 2

mp1KMeans: the mixed precision kmeans algorithm using distance 1

mp2KMeans: the mixed precision kmeans algorithm using distance 2

allowKMeans1: kmeans performed in full low precision using distance 1

allowKMeans2: kmeans performed in full low precision using distance 2
